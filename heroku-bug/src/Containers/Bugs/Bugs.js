                        the text of your next webpage?! Lorem Ipsum's father was with 
                        Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.I don't think
                        anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know,
                        maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could
                        also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on
                         their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
